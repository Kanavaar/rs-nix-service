** Rust Service with Nix

This is the repo of me following the [[https://fasterthanli.me/series/building-a-rust-service-with-nix][Building a Rust Service with Nix series]], not more not less.

*** But what does this app do?

It prints cat ascii art on the terminal and later as a web application

*** Building

You just need nix because it installs everything else

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone https://github.com/kanavaar/rust-nix-service
  cd rust-nix-service
  direnv-allow # or nix-shell
  cargo build
#+END_SRC
